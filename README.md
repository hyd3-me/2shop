# Custom Authentication & Authorization System

This backend project implements a custom authentication and authorization system using Python, Django Rest Framework, and PostgreSQL. 

Key features include:
- User registration, login, logout, profile update, and soft deletion
- Role-based access control with fine-grained permissions
- Secure password storage with bcrypt
- Token-based authentication with JWT and/or session management
- API endpoints for user management and administrative control over access rules
- Mock views simulating business objects with proper access restrictions

The project focuses on designing a robust database schema and security mechanisms beyond default framework features, tailored for real-world access control scenarios.
